## JGPSS FRAMEWORK

JGPSS Framework is discrete time simulation general-purpose open source tool written in Java that allows you to model and simulate relative complex systems.

It is based on the GPSS syntax with a more intuitive UI that makes a model specification a very easy task.

## JGPSS World

In JGPSS, the world is simulated with entities moving through the model, called Transactions, that are envisioned as moving from Block to Block, where a Block represents a unit of action that affects the Transaction itself or other entities. JGPSS keeps track of statistics which bring in fixed form at the end of a simulation as standard report.

## Why JGPSS ?

Rather than focusing in complex code, JGPSS allows anyone with no-programming skills  to build a simulation world in a LEGO fashion way, where the modeler reassembles the Blocks structures to imitate a particular system. 

## What kind of things I can do with JGPSS?

JGPSS is so flexible that the user gives the semantics needed. Blocks could be facility-oriented (such as machines in a job shop) or transation-oriented (such as parts of work-in-progress, signals in electronic components or documents in a bureaucratic procedure)
